## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    This web application will track the vital signs of users and store them in the user's account. People who are diagnosed with heart conditions or go to the hospital related to their heart conditions are educated to keep a daily log of their heart rate and blood pressure daily. The goal of this web application is to move from logging vital signs from pen and paper to an online platform. The transition from written logs to a web application will allow our users to not only log vital signs, but be able to sort them by values and by input dates.

    The long term goal of this web application is not only recording and storing user vital signs on an online database, but to also eventually send these records to the user's primary physician or cardiologist. Another goal of this web-application is to notify users if their vital signs meet dangerous criteria and to warn the user to either retake their vital signs after a few minutes or to dial for emergency services. Another long term goal of this web-application is to also record and store the user's medication lists within the server database and to send a copy of the user's medication list to physicians as well.
    
### Features
    User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page, a view of their recorded vital signs, and a view of their medication list.

    Create an Entry: Users will be able to enter their cardiac related vital signs into the web application and have them stored in a database that is accessible at any time.

    Sort: Users will be able to see a data table of their vital signs and their medications and be able to sort both tables based parameters that the user will need.
